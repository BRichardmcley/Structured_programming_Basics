# Swapping Two Numbers in C Without Using a Third Variable

This repository contains a simple C program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.

## Explanation

The program swaps the values of two variables `a` and `b` without using a third variable. The swapping process involves three steps:

1. The sum of `a` and `b` is stored in `a`.
2. Now `a` is the sum of `a` and `b`, so subtracting `b` gives the original `a`, which is assigned to `b`.
3. At this point, `b` has the original `a`'s value, so subtracting `b` from `a` (which is the sum of `a` and `b`) gives the original `b`, which is assigned to `a`.

## Compilation and Execution

You can use the `gcc` compiler to compile and run this program. Here's how you can do it:
Preprocessing: This stage includes expansion of macros and inclusion of header files. You can run the preprocessor with the -E option:
gcc -E swap.c -o swap.i
This will generate the preprocessed code swap.i.
Compilation: This stage translates the preprocessed code into assembly code. You can run the compiler with the -S option:
gcc -S swap.i -o swap.s
This will generate the assembly code swap.s.
Assembly: This stage translates the assembly code into machine code, generating an object file. You can run the assembler with the -c option:
gcc -c swap.s -o swap.o
This will generate the object file swap.o.
Linking: This stage links the object file with the libraries and generates the executable. You can run the linker by simply using gcc without any options:
gcc swap.o -o swap
