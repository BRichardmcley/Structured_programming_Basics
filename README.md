# Swapping Two Numbers in C Without Using a Third Variable
This repository contains a simple C program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.
 ## Explanation
The program swaps the values of two variables `a` and `b` without using a third variable. The swapping process involves three steps:
1. The sum of `a` and `b` is stored in `a`.
2. Now `a` is the sum of `a` and `b`, so subtracting `b` gives the original `a`, which is assigned to `b`.
3. At this point, `b` has the original `a`'s value, so subtracting `b` from `a` (which is the sum of `a` and `b`) gives the original `b`, which is assigned to `a`.

## Compilation and Execution

You can use the `gcc` compiler to compile and run this program. Here's how you can do it:

1. Save the program in a file, say `swap.c`.
2. Open a terminal in the directory containing `swap.c`.
3. Run `gcc -o swap swap.c` to compile the program. This will create an executable named `swap`.
4. Run `./swap` to execute the program.

# Calculating the Remainder Without Using the % Operator in C

This repository contains a simple C program that calculates the remainder of two numbers without using the `%` operator.

## Explanation

The program calculates the remainder of two numbers `dividend` and `divisor` without using the `%` operator. The process involves two steps:

1. The quotient of `dividend` and `divisor` is calculated.
2. The remainder is calculated by subtracting the product of the `quotient` and `divisor` from the `dividend`.

## Compilation Process

You can manually go through each of the four stages of the compilation process using `gcc`:

1. **Preprocessing**: This stage includes expansion of macros and inclusion of header files. You can run the preprocessor with the `-E` option:

    ```bash
    gcc -E remainder.c -o remainder.i
    ```
    This will generate the preprocessed code `remainder.i`.

2. **Compilation**: This stage translates the preprocessed code into assembly code. You can run the compiler with the `-S` option:

    ```bash
    gcc -S remainder.i -o remainder.s
    ```
    This will generate the assembly code `remainder.s`.

3. **Assembly**: This stage translates the assembly code into machine code, generating an object file. You can run the assembler with the `-c` option:

    ```bash
    gcc -c remainder.s -o remainder.o
    ```
    This will generate the object file `remainder.o`.

4. **Linking**: This stage links the object file with the libraries and generates the executable. You can run the linker by simply using `gcc` without any options:

    ```bash
    gcc remainder.o -o remainder
    ```
    This will generate the executable file `remainder`.

You can then run the executable with `./remainder`.

Please note that you can perform all these stages at once by running `gcc -o remainder remainder.c`. The `-o` option is used to specify the output file name.

# Calculating the Sum of Digits of a Three-Digit Number in C

This repository contains a simple C program that calculates the sum of digits of a three-digit number.

# Minimum Fixed Monthly Payment Calculator in C
This C program computes the minimum fixed monthly payment required to pay off a credit card balance within a year.

# Explanation

The user provides the initial balance (credit card balance) and the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal).
The program calculates the monthly interest rate by dividing the annual interest rate by 12.
It starts with an initial guess of $10 and iteratively increases the payment until the balance is paid off within a year.
The outer loop increments the minimum fixed monthly payment by $10 in each iteration.
The inner loop simulates 12 months of payments:
Deducts the monthly payment from the balance.
Adds the monthly interest on the remaining balance.
The process continues until the balance is paid off (monthlyUnpaidBalance becomes zero).
The program prints the lowest payment needed to pay off the loan.
