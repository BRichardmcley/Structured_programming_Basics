# Swapping Two Numbers in C Without Using a Third Variable

This repository contains a simple C program that swaps the values of two variables without using a third variable.

## Explanation

The program swaps the values of two variables `a` and `b` without using a third variable. The swapping process involves three steps:

1. The sum of `a` and `b` is stored in `a`.
2. Now `a` is the sum of `a` and `b`, so subtracting `b` gives the original `a`, which is assigned to `b`.
3. At this point, `b` has the original `a`'s value, so subtracting `b` from `a` (which is the sum of `a` and `b`) gives the original `b`, which is assigned to `a`.

## Compilation and Execution

You can use the `gcc` compiler to compile and run this program. Here's how you can do it:

1. Save the program in a file, say `swap.c`.
2. Open a terminal in the directory containing `swap.c`.
3. Run `gcc -o swap swap.c` to compile the program. This will create an executable named `swap`.
4. Run `./swap` to execute the program.
